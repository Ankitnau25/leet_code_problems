### Reranker Experimentation Summary

#### Introduction

In information retrieval, reranking is a crucial step where initial retrieval results are re-ordered to improve relevance. This experimentation aims to evaluate different reranking models to determine the most accurate and efficient one for our dataset.

#### Dataset Description

Our dataset consists of a set of queries and their corresponding paragraphs. Each paragraph is labeled as either "related" or "not related" to the query. The dataset is organized as follows:

- **Total Queries**: 3
- **Total Paragraphs**:
  - **Query 1**: 5 paragraphs
  - **Query 2**: 19 paragraphs
  - **Query 3**: 20 paragraphs

Each paragraph contains an ID, the paragraph text, and a "related" flag indicating its relevance to the query.

**Example Query and Paragraphs**:

```json
{
  "query": "What are the benefits of health insurance?",
  "paragraphs": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "Health insurance provides financial coverage for medical expenses such as doctor visits, hospital stays, and medications.",
      "related": true
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "Life insurance policies pay a lump sum to beneficiaries upon the policyholder's death.",
      "related": false
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "text": "With health insurance, you can access preventive services like vaccinations and screenings at no additional cost.",
      "related": true
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "text": "Car insurance covers damages to your vehicle in case of an accident.",
      "related": false
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "text": "Health insurance plans often cover a range of treatments, including surgeries and emergency care.",
      "related": true
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Methodology

The performance of different reranker models was evaluated using response time and reranker score metrics. The following steps were taken in the experimentation process:

1. Dataset preparation and preprocessing.
2. Configuration of Databricks environment.
3. Implementation of reranker models.
4. Execution of queries and collection of results.
5. Analysis of performance metrics.

#### Environment Setup

The experimentation was conducted on a Databricks notebook with the following configuration:
- **Databricks Runtime Version**: [Insert Version]
- **Cluster Configuration**:
  - **Driver Type**: [Insert Driver Type]
  - **Worker Type**: [Insert Worker Type]
  - **Number of Workers**: [Insert Number of Workers]
- **Libraries and Versions**:

#### Experimentation Workflow

Each query and its related paragraphs were sent at once to the different models for reranking. Below is an example of how the queries were processed:

```python
# Example code snippet
query = "What are the benefits of health insurance?"
paragraphs = [
    {"id": 1, "text": "Health insurance provides financial coverage for medical expenses...", "related": True},
    {"id": 2, "text": "Life insurance policies pay a lump sum to beneficiaries...", "related": False},
    # Additional paragraphs
]

# Send to reranker model
results = reranker_model.rerank(query, paragraphs)
```

#### Results Summary

The performance of each reranker was measured in terms of response time and reranker score. Below is a summary of the findings:

- **FlashRankZsMiniLLM** and **BGE** were found to be the most accurate rerankers.
- **FlashRankZsMiniLLM** was the fastest reranker.
