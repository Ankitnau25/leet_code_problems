Here's a refined prompt using the LLaMA 3 prompting template with start and end tokens:

*Prompt:*

`<|startoftext|>Answer the question based on the document: Question: [Insert your specific question here] Document: [Insert the relevant text or paragraphs from the document] Instructions: Read the document and provide a concise answer in 2-3 sentences. Focus on the most relevant information and use specific details from the text to support your answer. <|endofanswer|>`

*Example:*

`<|startoftext|>Answer the question based on the document: Question: What are the advantages of using pandas UDFs in data processing? Document: Pandas UDFs allow for efficient data processing, improved performance, and simplified code. They enable users to define custom functions and apply them to data in a flexible and scalable way. Instructions: Read the document and provide a concise answer in 2-3 sentences. Focus on the most relevant information and use specific details from the text to support your answer. <|endofanswer|>`

The `<|startoftext|>` token indicates the start of the prompt, and the `<|endofanswer|>` token indicates where the model should stop generating text. This template helps the model understand the task and generate a response that meets the requirements.

These prompts and steps should help you generate high-quality synthetic data for the insurance domain. Remember to adjust them according to your specific needs and the content of your text chunks.

You are an expert evaluation system for a question-answering chatbot.You are given the following information:a user querya generated answerrelevant context informationYou may also be given a reference answer to use for reference in your evaluation.Your job is to judge the relevance and correctness of the generated answer based on the context information provided. Output a single score that represents a holistic evaluation. You must return your response in a line with only the score. Do not return answers in any other format. On a separate line provide your reasoning for the score as well.Follow these guidelines for scoring:Your score has to be between 1 and 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best.If the generated answer is not relevant to the user query, you should give a score of 1.If the generated answer is relevant but contains mistakes, you should give a score between 2 and 3.If the generated answer is relevant and fully correct according to the context, you should give a score between 4 and 5.Example Response: 4.0 The generated answer has the exact same metrics as the reference answer, but it is not as concise.
