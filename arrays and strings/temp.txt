Here's a refined prompt using the LLaMA 3 prompting template with start and end tokens:

*Prompt:*

`<|startoftext|>Answer the question based on the document: Question: [Insert your specific question here] Document: [Insert the relevant text or paragraphs from the document] Instructions: Read the document and provide a concise answer in 2-3 sentences. Focus on the most relevant information and use specific details from the text to support your answer. <|endofanswer|>`

*Example:*

`<|startoftext|>Answer the question based on the document: Question: What are the advantages of using pandas UDFs in data processing? Document: Pandas UDFs allow for efficient data processing, improved performance, and simplified code. They enable users to define custom functions and apply them to data in a flexible and scalable way. Instructions: Read the document and provide a concise answer in 2-3 sentences. Focus on the most relevant information and use specific details from the text to support your answer. <|endofanswer|>`

The `<|startoftext|>` token indicates the start of the prompt, and the `<|endofanswer|>` token indicates where the model should stop generating text. This template helps the model understand the task and generate a response that meets the requirements.


Here are the detailed steps for each prompt, along with output formats and two examples in the insurance domain:

*Step 1: Question Generation from Chunks*

_Prompt:_ "Generate a list of questions based on the content of the following text chunk: [insert chunk text]"
_Steps:_
1. Read the input text chunk.
2. Identify key entities, concepts, and relationships.
3. Generate questions based on the identified information.
_Output Format:_ List of questions (e.g., ["What is the policyholder's name?", "What is the coverage amount?"])
_Examples:_

```* Chunk Text: "The policyholder, John Doe, has a coverage amount of $100,000."
	+ Questions: ["What is the policyholder's name?", "What is the coverage amount?"]
* Chunk Text: "The insurance policy covers damages due to natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes."
	+ Questions: ["What types of natural disasters are covered?", "What is the scope of coverage?"]
```
*Step 2: Answer Generation*

_Prompt:_ "Answer the following question based on the content of the text chunk: [insert question] Document: [insert chunk text]"
_Steps:_
1. Read the input question and text chunk.
2. Identify relevant information in the text chunk.
3. Generate an answer based on the identified information.
_Output Format:_ Answer (e.g., "John Doe", "$100,000")
_Examples:_

```* Question: "What is the policyholder's name?"
	+ Chunk Text: "The policyholder, John Doe, has a coverage amount of $100,000."
	+ Answer: "John Doe"
* Question: "What is the coverage amount?"
	+ Chunk Text: "The policyholder, John Doe, has a coverage amount of $100,000."
	+ Answer: "$100,000"
```
*Step 3: Answer Evaluation*

_Prompt:_ "Evaluate the answer to the following question: [insert question] Answer: [insert answer] Document: [insert chunk text] Identify any missing information or errors in the answer."
_Steps:_
1. Read the input question, answer, and text chunk.
2. Verify the answer against the text chunk.
3. Identify any missing information or errors.
_Output Format:_ Evaluation result (e.g., "Correct", "Missing information: policyholder's address")
_Examples:_

```* Question: "What is the policyholder's name?"
	+ Answer: "John Doe"
	+ Chunk Text: "The policyholder, John Doe, has a coverage amount of $100,000."
	+ Evaluation: "Correct"
* Question: "What is the policyholder's address?"
	+ Answer: "Not mentioned"
	+ Chunk Text: "The policyholder, John Doe, has a coverage amount of $100,000."
	+ Evaluation: "Missing information: policyholder's address"
```

Here are the remaining steps:

_Step 4: Question Filtering and Answer Correction_

_Prompt:_ "Filter out questions without answers or with missing information. Correct answers with missing information based on the content of the text chunk: [insert chunk text]"
_Steps:_
1. Evaluate each question and its corresponding answer.
2. Filter out questions without answers or with missing information.
3. Correct answers with missing information.
_Output Format:_ Filtered questions and corrected answers
_Examples:_

```
* Chunk Text: "The policyholder, John Doe, has a coverage amount of $100,000."
	+ Questions: ["What is the policyholder's name?", "What is the policyholder's address?"]
	+ Answers: ["John Doe", "Not mentioned"]
	+ Filtered Questions: ["What is the policyholder's name?"]
	+ Corrected Answers: ["John Doe"]
* Chunk Text: "The insurance policy covers damages due to natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes."
	+ Questions: ["What types of natural disasters are covered?", "What is the scope of coverage?"]
	+ Answers: ["earthquakes and hurricanes", "Not mentioned"]
	+ Filtered Questions: ["What types of natural disasters are covered?"]
	+ Corrected Answers: ["earthquakes and hurricanes"]
```
_Step 5: Ground Truth Generation_

_Prompt:_ "Generate ground truth answers for the following questions based on the content of the text chunk: [insert questions] Document: [insert chunk text]"
_Steps:_
1. Read the input questions and text chunk.
2. Identify relevant information in the text chunk.
3. Generate ground truth answers.
_Output Format:_ Ground truth answers
_Examples:_

```
* Questions: ["What is the policyholder's name?", "What is the coverage amount?"]
	+ Chunk Text: "The policyholder, John Doe, has a coverage amount of $100,000."
	+ Ground Truth Answers: ["John Doe", "$100,000"]
* Questions: ["What types of natural disasters are covered?", "What is the scope of coverage?"]
	+ Chunk Text: "The insurance policy covers damages due to natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes."
	+ Ground Truth Answers: ["earthquakes and hurricanes", "damages due to natural disasters"]
```
These prompts and steps should help you generate high-quality synthetic data for the insurance domain. Remember to adjust them according to your specific needs and the content of your text chunks.
