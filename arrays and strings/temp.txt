## Project Description

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow, allowing users to preprocess their documents and then ask questions based on the processed documents. The preprocessing module handles converting PDFs to DOCX (if possible), chunking the documents, and extracting metadata using the Unstructured library, LlamaIndex, and Mistral. The processed chunks and metadata are stored in a Delta table for efficient retrieval and querying.

The inference module deploys these functionalities as a Databricks endpoint. Users can query the processed data, and the system uses a combination of query intent and retrieval strategies to provide relevant responses. The RAG workflow ensures that user queries are augmented with retrieved information from the document chunks to generate accurate and contextually relevant answers.
