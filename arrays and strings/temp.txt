   - If the score is 5, output `True` followed by a new line with the reason: "Score is already 5."
   - If the score is less than 5, proceed to the next step.

2. **Evaluate the Score Explanation:**
   - Identify missing elements or areas for improvement in the original answer based on the explanation.

3. **Attempt to Improve the Answer:**
